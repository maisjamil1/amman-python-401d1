# Lab: Tying it all Together

## Overview

It's time to stitch the front and the back ends. In fact we'll break the back end in two and stitch that together as well.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

- Deploy API to Heroku in a Docker container
  - API *resource* can be simple
- Deploy NextJS Front end to Vercel
- Deploy PostgreSQL database to ElephantSQL
- Get them all to work together as a CRUD app

## Implementation Notes

- Set up a free account with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/){:target="_blank"}
- Set up a free account with [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/){:target="_blank"}
- Make sure [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/){:target="_blank"} is in working order.
  - Install [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli){:target="_blank"}

### User Acceptance Tests

- Single (manual) test for today. It should work!

## Configuration

**NOTE**: Replace `snacks` with your own resource name.

- Create `snacks-next` repo on Github
- Create `snacks-api` repo on Github

- URL to front end web app hosted on Vercel.
