# Lab: React III - Next.js

## Overview

Build a multi page web app using Next.js to consume an external API.

The app will display most recent XKCD comic and have links to previous 10 comics.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

- Refer to [example site](https://xkcd-two.now.sh/){:target="_blank"}
- Web app should have 2 static routes
  - Home page at "/"
  - About page at "/about"
- Web app should have dynamic routes
  - Dynamic route should display a single comic

## Implementation Notes

- Refer to [XKCD API](https://xkcd.com/json.html){:target="_blank"}
  - Inspect the data returned to determine the dynamic links needed.
- `basic-css` is a good, stripped down, starter template.

### Stretch Goals

- Make a "hybrid" app where Home and About pages are statically generated
- Style using Sass instead of CSS
- Publish web app to the web
- Use alternate http client instead of axios
- HINT: check Next.js blog for help with the stretch goals

### Useful Terminal Commands

- `npx create-next-app`
  - Alternate style:  `npm install react react-dom next`
- `npm run dev`

### User Acceptance Tests

No automated testing today. Your goal is to match appearance and functionality of reference web app.

## Configuration

- Create Github repository named `daily-xkcd`
- Submit pull request to completed project.
- Don't forget to add `node_modules` and `.next` folders to `.gitignore`
